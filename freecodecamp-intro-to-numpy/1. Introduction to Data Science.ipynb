    "\n",
    "If the data comes from different sources, merging it can be tedious. Specially if it's hard to define that piece of information that relates different data sources.\n",

    "**Doing the analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves your own domain expertise + the tools available for the job. For example, you need to know the principles of statistics and you can also use [`statsmodels`](https://www.statsmodels.org) to simplify your job. The analysis part is usually iterative and involves other subtasks as visualizations, validation testing, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Building models**\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of the analysis part is finding patterns in particular cases to build general models. Your models can be predictions, clusterings, or just automated reports. In a general sense, it's the result of all the previous phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deploying it**\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect analyses and models are useless if they're not repeatable and scalable. This phase depends on your own models, but it'll usually imply a cloud provider. From simple reports (emailed every day at 3AM from an AWS Lambda) to a Machine Learning Model (built on top of Tensor Flow and deployed on Google's cloud infrastructure)."
