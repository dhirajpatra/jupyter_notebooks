With sound understanding of the characteristics and operation of these matrices, you will have a good start to learn many financial analytical techniques. During the lesson, we will also use stock prices and returns as examples to demonstrate the usage of these matrices. We will use Apple, Ford Motor, and Walmart's stock returns to explain the applications of these matrices.*"

    "### **1.1. Definition of Symmetric Matrices**\n",
    "A **symmetric matrix** is a square matrix whose transpose is the same as the matrix itself. A square matrix is a matrix that has the same number of rows as the number of columns. The following example demonstrates the concept of a symmetric matrix.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "$$A= \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "m & a & b \\\\\n",

    "b & c & p\n",

    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In the above example, the second matrix is the transpose of $A$ matrix. The elements of the original matrix and its transpose are the same. In mathematical notation, for matrix $A$, if $A = A^{T}$, then $A$ is symmetric. To be more specific, the element at position (i,j) is equal to the element at position (j,i) for all i and j.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Here are some key properties of a symmetric matrix:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;1. The eigenvalues of the matrix are real numbers.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;2. The eigenvectors of the matrix are orthogonal to each other.\n",

    "In this lesson, we introduced a few special matrices and some linear algebra tools related to these matrices. We started with the definition and properties of a symmetric matrix and then its application, especially its diagonalized form. Then, we described what upper and lower triangular matrices are. We moved to symmetric positive definite matrices followed by symmetric positive semidefinite matrices. We finished the lesson by introducing Cholesky factorization. We provided the definition and went through one numeric example. We ended the section with a Cholesky factorization application with a Monte Carlo simulation. All these special matrices will play important roles in the financial analysis tools we are going to learn in future lessons."
