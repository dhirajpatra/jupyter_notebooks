# ARIMA Models in Python

Have you ever tried to predict the future? What lies ahead is a mystery that is usually only solved by waiting. In this notebook, we will stop waiting and learn to use the powerful ARIMA class models to forecast the future. You will learn how to use the statsmodels package to analyze time series, build tailored models, and forecasting under uncertainty. How will the stock market move in the next 24 hours? How will the levels of CO2 change in the next decade? How many earthquakes will there be next year? You will learn to solve all these problems and more.
