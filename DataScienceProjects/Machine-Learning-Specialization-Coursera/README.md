### Course Review :

This Course is a best place towards becoming a Machine Learning Engineer. Even if you're an expert, many algorithms are covered in depth such as decision trees which may help in further improvement of skills.

**Special thanks to [Professor Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/) for structuring and tailoring this Course.**

#### An insight of what you might be able to accomplish at the end of this specialization :

* <i>Write an unsupervised learning algorithm to **Land the Lunar Lander** Using Deep Q-Learning</i>

    - The Rover was trained to land correctly on the surface, correctly between the flags as indicators after many unsuccessful attempts in learning how to do it.
    - The final landing after training the agent using appropriate parameters :

* <i>Write an algorithm for a **Movie Recommender System**</i>
    
    - A movie database is collected based on its genre.
    - A content based filtering and collaborative filtering algorithm is trained and the movie recommender system is implemented.
    - It gives movie recommendentations based on the movie genre.

* <i> And Much More !! </i>


Concluding, this is a course which I would recommend everyone to take. Not just because you learn many new stuffs, but also the assignments are real life examples which are *exciting to complete*. 

<br/>

**Happy Learning :))**
