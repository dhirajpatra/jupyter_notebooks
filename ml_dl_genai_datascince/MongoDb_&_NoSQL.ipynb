        "Let's dive into MongoDB and how to use it via `mongosh` (MongoDB Shell). MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database, known for storing data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON. It’s widely used due to its scalability and ease of use. `mongosh` is the command-line interface for interacting with MongoDB.\n",
