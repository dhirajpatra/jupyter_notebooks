    "# MongoDB\n",
    "Let's dive into MongoDB and how to use it via `mongosh` (MongoDB Shell). MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database, known for storing data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON. It’s widely used due to its scalability and ease of use. `mongosh` is the command-line interface for interacting with MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this as clear as possible, I'll break down the process step-by-step, using analogies where appropriate to make the technical details easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MongoDB Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Database** (maps to Postgres DATABASE):\n",
    "   - Think of a database as a file cabinet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collection** (maps to Postgres TABLE):\n",
    "   - A collection is like a drawer in the file cabinet.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Document** (maps to Postgres row in a table):\n",
    "   - A document is like a file within the drawer. It’s a single record in the collection, stored in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Setting Up MongoDB and mongosh\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine MongoDB as a large, well-organized library where each book (database) contains chapters (collections) filled with pages (documents).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Pull Latest Mongo Docker Image**\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  docker pull mongo\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Create Mongo Container**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name=mongo-example mongo\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "**Step 3: Exec-ing into Mongo Container**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  docker exec -it mongo-example mongosh\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Basic MongoDB Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating a Database**\n",
    "- To create or switch to a database, use the `use` command:\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  use myLibrary\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  This doesn't create a database until you actually add data to it. Think of it as walking into a new section of the library and setting up shelves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Listing Databases**\n",
    "- To list all databases:\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  show dbs\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "Collections in MongoDB are like books in the library. Each collection contains documents, analogous to pages in a book.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating a Collection**\n",
    "- To create a collection, you simply start using it:\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  db.createCollection(\"myCollection\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Listing Collections**\n",
    "- To list all collections in the current database:\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  show collections\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "Documents are the main units of data in MongoDB, similar to how pages are units in a book. They are JSON-like structures (BSON).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inserting Documents**\n",
    "- To insert a document into a collection:\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  db.myCollection.insertOne({ title: \"MongoDB Basics\", author: \"John Doe\", year: 2023 })\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  This command adds a page (document) with the given details to the book (collection).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finding Documents**\n",
    "- To find documents in a collection:\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  db.myCollection.find()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  This command retrieves all documents from the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Updating Documents**\n",
    "- To update documents in a collection:\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  db.myCollection.updateOne({ title: \"MongoDB Basics\" }, { $set: { year: 2024 } })\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  This updates the `year` field of the document with the title \"MongoDB Basics\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deleting Documents**\n",
    "- To delete documents from a collection:\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  db.myCollection.deleteOne({ title: \"MongoDB Basics\" })\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  This deletes the document with the specified title.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Advanced Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes in MongoDB are like the index in a book, helping you quickly find the information you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating an Index**\n",
    "- To create an index on a field:\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  db.myCollection.createIndex({ title: 1 })\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  This creates an ascending index on the `title` field.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation operations process data records and return computed results. They are similar to SQL's GROUP BY operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aggregation Example**\n",
    "- To group documents by author and count the number of books by each:\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  db.myCollection.aggregate([\n",
    "    { $group: { _id: \"$author\", count: { $sum: 1 } } }\n",
    "  ])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s go through a practical example where we create a library database, add a collection of books, and perform some operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Switch to the Library Database**\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   use library\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Books Collection and Insert Documents**\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   db.createCollection(\"books\")\n",
    "   db.books.insertMany([\n",
    "     { title: \"MongoDB Basics\", author: \"John Doe\", year: 2023 },\n",
    "     { title: \"Advanced MongoDB\", author: \"Jane Smith\", year: 2024 }\n",
    "   ])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find All Books**\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   db.books.find()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update a Book's Year**\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   db.books.updateOne({ title: \"MongoDB Basics\" }, { $set: { year: 2024 } })\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Delete a Book**\n",
    "   ```sh\n",
    "   db.books.deleteOne({ title: \"Advanced MongoDB\" })\n",

    "\n",
    "Each document includes:\n",
    "- `listing_id`: A unique identifier for the listing.\n",
    "- `name`: The name of the listing.\n",
    "- `summary`: A brief description of the listing.\n",
    "- `property_type`: The type of property (e.g., House, Apartment).\n",
    "- `space`: An embedded document detailing the number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and beds.\n",
    "- `address`: An embedded document containing the street and suburb.\n",
    "- `reviews`: An array of embedded documents, each representing a review.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MongoDB Operations on Sample Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's perform various operations to interact with the data, including CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Inserting Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To insert a document into a collection, you use the `insertOne` or `insertMany` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "db.listingsAndReviews.insertOne({\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, a new listing is added to the `listingsAndReviews` collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Querying Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To find documents in a collection, use the `find` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "db.listingsAndReviews.find({\"address.street\": \"New York, NY, United States\"});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command retrieves all listings located on \"New York, NY, United States\" street.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Updating Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To update existing documents, use the `updateOne` or `updateMany` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "db.listingsAndReviews.updateOne(\n",

    "### MongoDB Aggregation Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The aggregation framework is a powerful feature in MongoDB that allows you to perform data processing and transformation tasks. It works by passing documents through a series of stages, each performing a specific operation. The output of one stage is the input to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Finding the Average Number of Beds by Property Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate the average number of beds for each property type.\n",

    "  {\n",
    "    $sort: { averageBeds: -1 }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `$group`: Groups documents by `property_type` and calculates the average number of beds (`$avg: \"$space.beds\"`).\n",
    "- `_id`: The field by which to group (in this case, `property_type`).\n",
    "- `$sort`: Sorts the results in descending order based on the `averageBeds`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalent SQL:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "SELECT property_type, AVERAGE(SPACE_BEDS) AS averageBeds FROM listingsAndReviews GROUP BY property_type ORDER BY 2 DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Counting Listings per Suburb\n",
    "\n",
    "To count the number of listings in each suburb:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate([\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    $group: {\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `$group`: Groups documents by `suburb` and counts the number of listings (`$sum: 1`).\n",
    "- `$sort`: Sorts the results in descending order based on the `listingCount`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: Aggregating Reviews Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s aggregate review data to find the average number of reviews per listing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate([\n",

    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `$project`: Creates a new field `reviewCount` which is the size of the `reviews` array.\n",
    "- `$group`: Groups all documents (since `_id` is `null`) and calculates the average number of reviews (`$avg: \"$reviewCount\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 4: Filtering Listings with High Review Counts\n",
    "\n",
    "Find listings with more than 10 reviews:\n",

    "  {\n",
    "    $match: { reviewCount: { $gt: 10 } }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `$project`: Creates a new field `reviewCount` which is the size of the `reviews` array and includes `listing_id` and `name` in the output.\n",
    "- `$match`: Filters documents where `reviewCount` is greater than 10.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Connection**: We connect to the MongoDB server running on `localhost` at port `27017`.\n",
    "2. **Database Access**: We access (or create) a database named `example_database`.\n",
    "3. **Data Preparation**: We prepare a list of dictionaries, each representing a book with various attributes.\n",
    "4. **Data Insertion**: We insert the list of books into a collection named `example_collection`.\n",
    "5. **Queries**: We perform various queries to retrieve and print data based on different criteria.\n"
