        "4. **Error Handling**:\n",
        "   - Ensures placeholders are properly substituted and avoids missing or malformed prompts.\n",

        "   - Example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     template_str = \"Use the following information to answer the question:\\n\\n{context}\\n\\nQuestion: {question}\"\n",
        "     ```\n",

        "2. **Dynamic Placeholders**:\n",

        "- **Clarity**: Keep the prompt structure organized and consistent.\n",
        "- **Flexibility**: Adapt to various use cases like summarization, QA systems, or chatbot interactions."

        "\n",
        "1. **Structured Prompt Design**: We can create a multi-part prompt where distinct roles (system and human) are defined to interact with a language model. Each role contributes to structuring the input for clarity and context.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Template-Based Customization**: We can use placeholders (`{context}`, `{question}`) to dynamically inject specific inputs into predefined templates, making the prompts flexible and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Role-Specific Prompts**: The system and human prompts can be designed separately:\n",
        "   - **System Message**: Sets the overarching instructions or rules for the language model's behavior.\n",
        "   - **Human Message**: Provides the specific question or user input for the task.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Combination of Messages**: Both the system and human prompts can be combined into a list (`messages`), creating a cohesive structure for multi-turn or contextual conversations.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Dynamic Input Formatting**: The `ChatPromptTemplate` integrates the messages and formats them with actual input values (`context` and `question`), generating a well-structured prompt to guide the language model's response."
