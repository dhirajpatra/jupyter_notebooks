It achieves superior results in machine translation tasks, is highly parallelizable, and requires less training time compared to existing models. The Transformer also demonstrates good generalization to other tasks such as English constituency parsing. The model architecture consists of stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder. The attention mechanism used in the Transformer is called \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" and it computes the dot products of queries with keys, divides each by the square root of the dimension, and applies a softmax function to obtain weights on the values. The Transformer employs \"Multi-Head Attention\" where the queries, keys, and values are linearly projected multiple times and the attention function is performed in parallel on these projected versions, resulting in concatenated output values. The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways: in \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder; the encoder contains self-attention layers where all of the keys, values, and queries come from the same place, and each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder; and self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position.

      "We have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: The paper introduces the Transformer, a network architecture that relies solely on attention mechanisms and achieves superior results in machine translation tasks. It is highly parallelizable and requires less training time compared to existing models. The Transformer also demonstrates good generalization to other tasks such as English constituency parsing. The model architecture consists of stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder. The attention mechanism used in the Transformer is called \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" and it computes the dot products of queries with keys, divides each by the square root of the dimension, and applies a softmax function to obtain weights on the values. The Transformer employs \"Multi-Head Attention\" where the queries, keys, and values are linearly projected multiple times and the attention function is performed in parallel on these projected versions, resulting in concatenated output values. The model also includes position-wise feed-forward networks and uses learned embeddings and softmax for input and output tokens. The paper compares self-attention layers to recurrent and convolutional layers in terms of computational complexity, parallelizability, and path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Self-attention layers have a lower computational complexity and can be parallelized more efficiently, making them faster than recurrent layers for smaller sequence lengths. The paper also discusses the potential for self-attention to yield more interpretable models and describes the training regime, including the training data, hardware, optimizer, and regularization techniques used. The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks at a fraction of the training cost.

      "Summary: George Washington (February 22, 1732 – December 14, 1799) was an American Founding Father, military officer, politician and statesman who served as the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797. Appointed by the Second Continental Congress as commander of the Continental Army in 1775, Washington led Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War and then served as president of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which drafted and ratified the Constitution of the United States and established the U.S. federal government. Washington has thus been known as the \"Father of the Nation\".\n",
      "Washington's first public office, from 1749 to 1750, was as surveyor of Culpeper County in the Colony of Virginia. He subsequently received military training and was assigned command of the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War. He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was named a delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which appointed him commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. Washington led American forces to a decisive victory over the British in the Revolutionary War, leading the British to sign the Treaty of Paris, which acknowledged the sovereignty and independence of the United States. He resigned his commission in 1783 after the conclusion of the Revolutionary War.\n",
      "Washington played an indispensable role in adopting and ratifying the Constitution, which replaced the Articles of Confederation in 1789. He was then twice elected president by the Electoral College unanimously. As the first U.S. president, Washington implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry that emerged between cabinet members Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while additionally sanctioning the Jay Treaty. He set enduring precedents for the office of president, including republicanism, a peaceful transfer of power, the use of the title \"Mr. President\", and the two-term tradition. His 1796 farewell address became a preeminent statement on republicanism in which he wrote about the importance of national unity and the dangers that regionalism, partisanship, and foreign influence pose to it.\n",
      "Washington's image is an icon of American culture. He has been memorialized by monuments, a federal holiday, various media depictions, geographical locations including the national capital, the State of Washington, stamps, and currency. In 1976, Washington was posthumously promoted to the rank of general of the Armies, the highest rank in the U.S. Army. Washington consistently ranks in both popular and scholarly polls as one of the greatest presidents in American history.\n",

      "Summary: George Washington Carver (c. 1864 – January 5, 1943) was an American agricultural scientist and inventor who promoted alternative crops to cotton and methods to prevent soil depletion. He was one of the most prominent black scientists of the early 20th century.\n",
      "While a professor at Tuskegee Institute, Carver developed techniques to improve types of soils depleted by repeated plantings of cotton. He wanted poor farmers to grow other crops, such as peanuts and sweet potatoes, as a source of their own food and to improve their quality of life. The most popular of his 44 practical bulletins for farmers contained 105 food recipes using peanuts. Although he spent years developing and promoting numerous products made from peanuts, none became commercially successful.Apart from his work to improve the lives of farmers, Carver was also a leader in promoting environmentalism. He received numerous honors for his work, including the Spingarn Medal of the NAACP. In an era of high racial polarization, his fame reached beyond the black community. He was widely recognized and praised in the white community for his many achievements and talents. In 1941, Time mag\u001b[0m\n",
