    "# LangGraph GraphRAG agent with Llama 3.1 and GPT4o\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build an Advanced RAG with a GraphRAG agent that will run a combination of Llama 3.1 and GPT4o, for Llama 3.1 we will use Ollama. The idea is that we use GPT4o for advanced tasks, like generating the Neo4j query and Llama3.1 for the rest. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll combine ideas from three RAG papers into a RAG agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Routing:**  Adaptive RAG ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14403)). Route questions to different retrieval approaches\n",
    "- **Fallback:** Corrective RAG ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15884.pdf)). Fallback to web search if docs are not relevant to query\n",
    "- **Self-correction:** Self-RAG ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11511)). Fix answers w/ hallucinations or donâ€™t address question\n",
    "\n",
    "![langgraph_adaptive_rag.png](imgs/RAG_Agent_langGraph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this will incorperate [a few general ideas for agents](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-agents-can-improve-llm-performance/):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reflection**: The self-correction mechanism is a form of reflection, where the LangGraph agent reflects on its retrieval and generations\n",
    "- **Planning**: The control flow laid out in the graph is a form of planning \n",
    "- **Tool use**: Specific nodes in the control flow (e.g., web search) will use tools\n",

A prompt is a natural language instruction designed to elicit certain behaviour or output from a model. In theory, natural language prompts enable non-experts to interact with and leverage LLMs. However, for complex tasks and tasks with specific requirements, prompt design is not trivial. Creating effective prompts requires skill and knowledge, as well as significant iteration in order to determine model behavior, and guide the model to accomplish a particular goal. We hypothesize that the way in which users iterate on their prompts can provide insight into how they think prompting and models work, as well as the kinds of support needed for more efficient prompt engineering. To better understand prompt engineering practices, we analyzed sessions of prompt editing behavior, categorizing the parts of prompts users iterated on and the types of changes they made.
