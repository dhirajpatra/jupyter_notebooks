    "This notebook demonstrates how to use LangChain to build a chatbot that references a custom knowledge-base. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have some text documents (PDF, blog, Notion pages, etc.) and want to ask questions related to the contents of those documents. LLMs, given their proficiency in understanding text, are a great tool for this. \n",

    "### [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction)\n",
    "[**LangChain**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) provides a simple framework for connecting LLMs to your own data sources. Since LLMs are both only trained up to a fixed point in time and do not contain knowledge that is proprietary to an Enterprise, they can't answer questions about new or proprietary knowledge. LangChain solves this problem.\n",

    "⚠️ The notebook after this one, `03_llama_index_simple.ipynb`, contains the same functionality as this notebook but uses LlamaIndex instead of LangChain. Ultimately, we recommend reading about LangChain vs. LlamaIndex and picking the software/components of the software that makes the most sense to you. \n",
