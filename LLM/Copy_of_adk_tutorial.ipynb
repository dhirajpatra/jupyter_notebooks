        "# Build Your First Intelligent Agent Team: A Progressive Weather Bot with ADK\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial extends from the [Quickstart example](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/quickstart/) for [Agent Development Kit](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/). Now, you're ready to dive deeper and construct a more sophisticated, **multi-agent system**.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll embark on building a **Weather Bot agent team**, progressively layering advanced features onto a simple foundation. Starting with a single agent that can look up weather, we will incrementally add capabilities like:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Leveraging different AI models (Gemini, GPT, Claude).\n",
        "*   Designing specialized sub-agents for distinct tasks (like greetings and farewells).\n",
        "*   Enabling intelligent delegation between agents.\n",
        "*   Giving agents memory using persistent session state.\n",
        "*   Implementing crucial safety guardrails using callbacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why a Weather Bot Team?**\n",
        "\n",
        "This use case, while seemingly simple, provides a practical and relatable canvas to explore core ADK concepts essential for building complex, real-world agentic applications. You'll learn how to structure interactions, manage state, ensure safety, and orchestrate multiple AI \"brains\" working together.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is ADK Again?**\n",
        "\n",
        "As a reminder, ADK is a Python framework designed to streamline the development of applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It offers robust building blocks for creating agents that can reason, plan, utilize tools, interact dynamically with users, and collaborate effectively within a team.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In this advanced tutorial, you will master:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   ✅ **Tool Definition & Usage:** Crafting Python functions (`tools`) that grant agents specific abilities (like fetching data) and instructing agents on how to use them effectively.\n",
        "*   ✅ **Multi-LLM Flexibility:** Configuring agents to utilize various leading LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet) via LiteLLM integration, allowing you to choose the best model for each task.\n",
        "*   ✅ **Agent Delegation & Collaboration:** Designing specialized sub-agents and enabling automatic routing (`auto flow`) of user requests to the most appropriate agent within a team.\n",
        "*   ✅ **Session State for Memory:** Utilizing `Session State` and `ToolContext` to enable agents to remember information across conversational turns, leading to more contextual interactions.\n",
        "*   ✅ **Safety Guardrails with Callbacks:** Implementing `before_model_callback` and `before_tool_callback` to inspect, modify, or block requests/tool usage based on predefined rules, enhancing application safety and control.\n",
        "\n",
        "**End State Expectation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "By completing this tutorial, you will have built a functional multi-agent Weather Bot system. This system will not only provide weather information but also handle conversational niceties, remember the last city checked, and operate within defined safety boundaries, all orchestrated using ADK.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prerequisites:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   ✅ **Solid understanding of Python programming.**\n",
        "*   ✅ **Familiarity with Large Language Models (LLMs), APIs, and the concept of agents.**\n",
        "*   ❗ **Crucially: Completion of the ADK Quickstart tutorial(s) or equivalent foundational knowledge of ADK basics (Agent, Runner, SessionService, basic Tool usage).** This tutorial builds directly upon those concepts.\n",
        "*   ✅ **API Keys** for the LLMs you intend to use (e.g., Google AI Studio for Gemini, OpenAI Platform, Anthropic Console).\n",

        "**Note on Execution Environment:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial is structured for interactive notebook environments like Google Colab, Colab Enterprise, or Jupyter notebooks. Please keep the following in mind:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Running Async Code:** Notebook environments handle asynchronous code differently. You'll see examples using `await` (suitable when an event loop is already running, common in notebooks) or `asyncio.run()` (often needed when running as a standalone `.py` script or in specific notebook setups). The code blocks provide guidance for both scenarios.\n",
        "*   **Manual Runner/Session Setup:** The steps involve explicitly creating `Runner` and `SessionService` instances. This approach is shown because it gives you fine-grained control over the agent's execution lifecycle, session management, and state persistence.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Alternative: Using ADK's Built-in Tools (Web UI / CLI / API Server)**\n",
        "\n",
        "If you prefer a setup that handles the runner and session management automatically using ADK's standard tools, you can find the equivalent code structured for that purpose [here](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/tree/main/examples/python/tutorial/agent_team/adk-tutorial). That version is designed to be run directly with commands like `adk web` (for a web UI), `adk run` (for CLI interaction), or `adk api_server` (to expose an API). Please follow the `README.md` instructions provided in that alternative resource.\n",

        "*   You embraced **modularity** by creating specialized sub-agents (`greeting_agent`, `farewell_agent`) and enabling **automatic delegation** from a root agent.\n",
        "*   You gave your agents **memory** using **Session State**, allowing them to remember user preferences (`temperature_unit`) and past interactions (`output_key`).\n",
        "*   You implemented crucial **safety guardrails** using both `before_model_callback` (blocking specific input keywords) and `before_tool_callback` (blocking tool execution based on arguments like the city \"Paris\").\n",

        "*   **Delegation:** Designing multi-agent teams allows for specialization, modularity, and better management of complex tasks. Agent `description` is key for auto-flow.\n",
        "*   **Session State (`ToolContext`, `output_key`):** Essential for creating context-aware, personalized, and multi-turn conversational agents.\n",
        "*   **Callbacks (`before_model`, `before_tool`):** Powerful hooks for implementing safety, validation, policy enforcement, and dynamic modifications *before* critical operations (LLM calls or tool execution).\n",
        "*   **Flexibility (`LiteLlm`):** ADK empowers you to choose the best LLM for the job, balancing performance, cost, and features.\n",

        "Your Weather Bot team is a great starting point. Here are some ideas to further explore ADK and enhance your application:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Real Weather API:** Replace the `mock_weather_db` in your `get_weather` tool with a call to a real weather API (like OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI).\n",
        "2.  **More Complex State:** Store more user preferences (e.g., preferred location, notification settings) or conversation summaries in the session state.\n",
        "3.  **Refine Delegation:** Experiment with different root agent instructions or sub-agent descriptions to fine-tune the delegation logic. Could you add a \"forecast\" agent?\n",
        "4.  **Advanced Callbacks:**\n",
        "    *   Use `after_model_callback` to potentially reformat or sanitize the LLM's response *after* it's generated.\n",
        "    *   Use `after_tool_callback` to process or log the results returned by a tool.\n",
        "    *   Implement `before_agent_callback` or `after_agent_callback` for agent-level entry/exit logic.\n",
        "5.  **Error Handling:** Improve how the agent handles tool errors or unexpected API responses. Maybe add retry logic within a tool.\n",
        "6.  **Persistent Session Storage:** Explore alternatives to `InMemorySessionService` for storing session state persistently (e.g., using databases like Firestore or Cloud SQL – requires custom implementation or future ADK integrations).\n",
        "7.  **Streaming UI:** Integrate your agent team with a web framework (like FastAPI, as shown in the ADK Streaming Quickstart) to create a real-time chat interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Agent Development Kit provides a robust foundation for building sophisticated LLM-powered applications. By mastering the concepts covered in this tutorial – tools, state, delegation, and callbacks – you are well-equipped to tackle increasingly complex agentic systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Happy building!"
